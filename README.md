# Remote Data Extraction & SVG Visualization

# Description
This project was originally developed as part of a technical assessment from DataAnnotation.

I was instructed to decode a secret message by fetching a Google Doc URL that contains a list of Unicode characters and their positions in a 2D grid and write a function that:

1. Takes in one argument, which is a string containing the URL for the Google Doc with the input data, AND

2. When called, prints the grid of characters specified by the input data, displaying a graphic of correctly oriented uppercase letters.

# Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SimonProgAI/DataAnnotation.git
cd DataAnnotation 
```
2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
